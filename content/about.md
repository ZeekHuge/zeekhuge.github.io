Hi  ! I am Zubeen Tolani, AKA ZeekHuge, at least here on the internet space. I am an undergraduate student in the department of Electronics and Communication Engineering. I am not among those frustrated engineers, but among those happy ones, as I love what I do and vice-versa. Most of my work has been related to coding and digital systems. 
<p>
Right from my childhood, I was a kid that likes to open up all the gadgets and toys he has, trying to repair them if they have some problem and mostly ending up with a dead gadget or toy. Finally, I have started to actually make things work now, and not just making them dead. I use to skip my high school classes and practice C++ on school lab computers. That was really fun !
Actually I was first introduced to coding in my 6th std. by one of my teachers, but I never actually had a computer system for more than a few months, until a few years back.

#### Eh ? What does 'ZeekHuge' means ?
<font size="3">
Yeah, most of you might think that its a meaningless word, but believe me, it IS really meaningless. I was in my 7th/8th Std. and use to watch "The Suite Life of Zack & Cody" and one day a thought came in my mind, "Hey ! 'Zeek' is such a good name and I can keep it as my secret name !". AndA
