<br><br>
* <font size="4">A die hard Michael Jackson fan, and love all three, his dance, his music and him.</font>
<br><br>
* <font size="4">I love to read and discuss about **Physics**, **Existence of God**, **Mathematics** and **The true nature of this World**. So always assume that I am free for such discussions ( except when I am busy ).</font>
<br><br>
* <font size="4">Knowing that I am wrong, I still believe that : </font>

* <font size="4">Anything can be done in a time period of 3 months</font>
* <font size="4">An engineer can find solution to any problem in this world</font>

<font size="5"><u>**The long version:**</u></font>
<div style="font-family: 'Kalam', cursive;">
<br>
<font size="5"><u>Me:</u></font><p>

<font size="4">So basically, I love to solve problems that involve use of technology, and can have a good enough impact on things. As an example. Most of my work has been in embedded systems, digital electronics and software development. I know quite a few computer programming languages but I am most proficient in C and C++.</p><p>My real interest in programming and electronics came out in last 3-4 years. And during that time I have participated in inter college robotics competition, College level competitive programming contests, worked on some sponsored projects (one by Texas Instruments) and participated in Google Summer of Code 2016.</p><p> I have worked on embedded systems and have made a few simple robots like :

* Wirelessly Gesture controlled robot.
* Robot for rough terrains
* Autonomous to place blocks at right position
* and ofc, line followers.

<font size="5"><u>Whats 'ZeekHuge':</u></font><p>
<font size="4"><p>Yeah, most of you might be thinking that my alias 'ZeekHuge' is a meaningless word, and believe me, it really is meaningless. I was in my 7th-8th Std. and use to watch "The Suite Life of Zack & Cody" and one day an idea popped up in my mind = "Hey ! 'Zeek' is such a good name and I can keep it as my secret name !" And then, even I don't know how that *'Huge'* thing got attached with it... but anyway .. it looks cool ! Isn't it ? </p>
</font><br>

<font size="5"><u>Whats the VIM thingy ?:</u></font><p>
<font size="4"><p>What ? You want to read this section too ? You don't know what VIM is ? Its the only true editor that's left around now .... that's it ... and I love it :D ! Really ! I started using Vim about 5 months ago, when one of my mentors recommended it to me and then .. I have been using it for everything ... and getting taste of its power and yes, learning new things about it everyday !! In fact, I remapped some of navigation keys-bindings of **'tmux'** so as to match the key-bindings of **VIM**. I would just say, in capitals - **"vim is really great!"**.</p>
