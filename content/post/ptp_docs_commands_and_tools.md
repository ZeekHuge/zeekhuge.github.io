### <u>Preface:</u>
If the content here seems to be out of context, you'll probably want to start from [here](/post/ptp_blinky). 

So you have decided to play with PRUs and after this [blinky](/post/ptp_blinky) post, you have some understanding about how to work with PRUs. Cool ! Thats a courageous decision, as PRUs are quite challenging. To make life easier, we need some tools to work along. This post will help you make some of your own tools, using mostly bash scripts/aliases, and explain how to use other known tools with PRUs. Please note that some of the tools/use-cases will not make sense as of now, but I will still include them in the post for future reference. Some of these tools might seem very trivial, but I would still like to mention them (it may give hope to someone :) )

### <u>Documents</u>{#docs}
* You definitely know that the AM335x processor is manufactured by TI, and only they know what actually is inside the semiconductor. To tell this to the world, every semiconductor device, open to the world, comes with some kind of document explaining its internal working. For PRUs, I found the document at https://github.com/beagleboard/am335x_pru_package/. The pdf named am335xPruReferenceGuide.pdf is the one I am talking about. Its an ultimately important and nice document to keep with you. I use it all the time, when I am working with PRUs. If you want to download this click [here](https://github.com/beagleboard/am335x_pru_package/raw/master/am335xPruReferenceGuide.pdf).

---

### <u>Commands</u>{#cmd}
* In this section, we will add some commands to use them as our tools. **Please note that these commands may not be very clean, but they definitely server the purpose. When you will execute them, they might produce some output, but dont worry much about it, we can use 'dmesg' to do the real debugging and monitor what is happening as I have explained below in the post**. There will be an explanation about the working of the commands also. 

---

##### <u>Power management : PRUs : Details</u>{#pmd}
* This [blinky post](/post/ptp_blinky/) demonstrated how the deploy.sh script reboots the PRU. Now if you are deciding to play with PRUs frequently, there needs to be a tool to shut them down and boot them up, when needed, without doing the force rmmod of the pru_rproc. Now the remoteproc driver for PRUs, pru_proc handles the PRU core. It further exposes sysfs entries to boot and shutdown PRUs. So for PRU0 you can shut it down like this :
<pre class="prettyprint">
$ echo "4a334000.pru0" > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/pru-rproc/unbind
</pre>
and boot it up :
<pre class="prettyprint">
$ echo "4a334000.pru0" > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/pru-rproc/bind
</pre>

* At this point, you would want to make this **note that the device name of PRU core 0 is actually <u>4a334000.pru0</u> and that of the PRU core 1 is <u>4a338000.pru1</u>.** 

* So writing the device name of any of the pru cores to the 'bind' sysfs entry will make the remoteproc driver to boot that pru core. Similarly, writing a pru device name to 'unbind' sysfs entry will make that pru core to shutdown.

##### <u>Power management : PRUs : Commands</u>{#pmc}
* While working, I really don't like to type this long instruction to shutdown or boot the PRU. What I do is, I have added some aliases to my ~/.bashrc script, and believe me, they really make things easy. Just open the ~/.bash.rc in your favorite editor and append it with following aliases.

	+ **pshut1 : To shut PRU core 1** 
	<pre class="prettyprint">
	alias pshut1='echo 4a338000.pru1>/sys/bus/platform/drivers/pru-rproc/unbind && echo “Core 1 is off”'
	</pre>


	+ **pshut0 : To shut PRU core 0**
	<pre class="prettyprint">
	alias pshut0='echo 4a334000.pru0>/sys/bus/platform/drivers/pru-rproc/unbind && echo “Core 0 is off”'
	</pre>
	
	
	+ **pboot1 : To boot PRU core 1**
	<pre class="prettyprint">
	alias pboot1='echo 4a338000.pru1>/sys/bus/platform/drivers/pru-rproc/bind && echo “Core 1 is on”'
	</pre>
	
	+ **pboot0 : To boot PRU core 0**
	<pre class="prettyprint">
	alias pboot0='echo 4a334000.pru0>/sys/bus/platform/drivers/pru-rproc/bind && echo “Core 0 is on”'
	</pre>
	
	
	+ **preboot : To reboot both PRU cores**
	<pre class="prettyprint">
	alias preboot='echo 4a338000.pru1>/sys/bus/platform/drivers/pru-rproc/unbind &&
	               echo 4a334000.pru0>/sys/bus/platform/drivers/pru-rproc/unbind &&
	               echo 4a338000.pru1>/sys/bus/platform/drivers/pru-rproc/bind &&
	               echo 4a334000.pru0>/sys/bus/platform/drivers/pru-rproc/bind &&
	               echo "PRUs rebooted"'
	</pre>


##### <u>PRU debug : Details</u>{#pdd}
* Now here comes the interesting section. The PRUs are usually seen as these 'black boxes' as no one knows what is happening inside it. With the latest remoteproc, this is not true. We can actually see the content of the PRU registers or we can pru execute one instruction at a time, and then wait for the user for a instruction to execute next instruction. The pru_rproc driver exposes these debugfs entries :
<pre class="prettyprint">
$ root@beaglebone:/sys/kernel/debug/remoteproc# tree remoteproc0 
remoteproc0
|-- name
|-- recovery
|-- state
|-- trace0
`-- version
`
0 directories, 5 files
root@beaglebone:/sys/kernel/debug/remoteproc# tree remoteproc1
remoteproc1
|-- name
|-- recovery
|-- regs
|-- single_step
|-- state
`-- version
`
0 directories, 6 files
</pre>

* **NOTE that all these entries will appear only when the associated PRU is properly booted.** So remoteproc1 is associated with PRU1 and remoteproc0 is associated with PRU0.

* PRUs have this nice feature called the SINGLE_STEP mode. When activated in this mode, the PRU core executes one instruction, waits for a kind of flag from the user, executes the next instruction and this continues. To get PRU0 in the SINGLE_STEP mode, just :
<pre class="prettyprint">
$ echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/remoteproc/remoteproc0/single_step
</pre>
and for PRU1 it will be 
<pre class="prettyprint">
$ echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/remoteproc/remoteproc1/single_step
</pre>
So basically, writing 0 to the single_step entry, changes the PRU mode to continuous mode and writing a non-zero value starts the single_step mode. Internally, writing to single_step entry writes to the SINGLE_STEP field of the CONTROL register in the PRU_CTRL register set.

* Like any other computing system, PRUs has got a set of register and data-structures, for various purposes. Some of these are:
	+ **General Purpose registers.** So each PRU core has got this set of 32 general purpose register. While programming PRUs in C/C++, the compiler makes use of these registers for various purposes and one cant actually access a single register in C/C++, exception being the R31 and R30 register. But when programming them in Assembly, having something to peek into the contents of these register can be very useful tool. When the PRU is disabled, that is, it is not in continuous mode of fetching next instruction, the Kernel can actually read the content of these general purpose register.
	+ **PRU_CONTROL register.** PRUs has this set of registers called PRU_CTRL (read it PRU control) registers. It consists of CONTROL, STATUS, WAKEUP_EN, CYCLE, STALL, CTBIR0, CTBIR1, CTPPR0 and CTPPR1 register. The control various subsystems and accesses. The kernel can, at anytime read the content of these registers. By 'anytime' I mean that the PRU does not need to be disabled to read this register set.
	+ **PRU constant table.** This data structure contains the address of various subsystem that are most commonly used by the PRUs. Some of its entries can also be configured using the PRU_CTR registers. Programming in C/C++ removes the need of any access to this structure, it internally manages everything (except in a few cases). But if needed, the kernel can read the content of the constant table too, provided, the pru is disabled.

* To disable the PRUs, what one can do from userspace is, just write a non-zero value to the single_step debugfs entry, the PRU will execute one instruction and then will disable itself until you again write a value to the entry. In fact this is how the single_step mode works.

* After disabling the PRU, you can use the 'regs' entry to read the register content values.

##### <u>PRU debug : Commands</u>{#pdc}
* So here comes the set of aliases that I use to control PRUs for debugging. Just append them to your ~/.bashrc file and the will be in effect you login next time.
	+ **ppause1 and ppause0 - to pause the PRUs.** This basically changes the mode of the PRUs to single_step mode. PRUs execute one instruction and then gets paused
	<pre class="prettyprint">
	alias ppause1='echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/remoteproc/remoteproc1/single_step'
	alias ppause0='echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/remoteproc/remoteproc0/single_step'
	</pre>

	+ **presume1 and presume0 - to resume the PRUs.** Internally this brings back the PRU to continuous mode of operation.
	<pre class="prettyprint">
	alias presume1='echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/remoteproc/remoteproc1/single_step'
	alias presume0='echo 0 > /sys/kernel/debug/remoteproc/remoteproc0/single_step'
	</pre>

	+ **pnext1 and pnext0 - to execute the next step.** This starts the single_step mode of the PRUs and execute one next step each time invoked.
	<pre class="prettyprint">
	alias pnext1='echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/remoteproc/remoteproc1/single_step'
	alias pnext0='echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/remoteproc/remoteproc0/single_step'
	</pre>

	+ **pregs1 and pregs0 - to read the debug register content of the PRUs.** If you want to read all the register content, the PRU need to paused before the call to this alias. If it is not paused, only the PRU_CONTROL register content will be printed out.
	<pre class="prettyprint">
	alias pregs1='cat /sys/kernel/debug/remoteproc/remoteproc1/regs'
	alias pregs0='cat /sys/kernel/debug/remoteproc/remoteproc0/regs'
	</pre>

### <u>Tools</u>{#tools}
* Well, after all these commands/aliases we just added in the above section, I have one tool left for you that is 'dmesg'.

##### <u>dmesg : kernel logs and the PRU</u>{#dmesg}
* Yeah, I know that you already know this, but believe me, this 'dmesg' point this blog can prove to save many hours(and probably lives). OK so you think I am just wasting up space mentioning this point here ? really ? well, then just let me use some more of it :P

* Whenever I start working with the PRUs, what I usually do is, open up a new terminal, ssh into the BBB, change the title of the terminal to 'BBB dmesg' to make it easy to switch between 10-12 terminals, and then execute this command :
<pre class="prettyprint">
$ dmesg -Hw
</pre>
What it does is that it waits for new kernel log messages and prints them as they arrive. It also makes the output a bit colorful. 

* On booting or shutting down the PRUs, the remoteproc drivers print some kernel logs. These kernel log messages can be used to check if the firmware gets loaded on the PRU. 
	+ Kernel log messages when the PRUs are booted up :
