Hi  ! I am Zubeen Tolani, AKA ZeekHuge, at least here on the internet space. I am an undergraduate student in the department of Electronics and Communication Engineering. I am not among those frustrated engineers, but among those happy ones, as I love what I do and vice-versa. Most of my work has been related to coding and digital systems.
&lt;p&gt;
Right from my childhood, I was a kid that likes to open up all the gadgets and toys he has, trying to repair them if they have some problem and mostly ending up with a dead gadget or toy. Finally, I have started to actually make things work now, and not just making them dead. I use to skip my high school classes and practice C++ on school lab computers. That was really fun !
Actually I was first introduced to coding in my 6th std. by one of my teachers, but I never actually had a computer system for more than a few months, until a few years back.
&lt;/p&gt;
I was first introduced to coding
&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;eh-what-does-zeekhuge-means:6083a88ee3411b0d17ce02d738f69d47&#34;&gt;Eh ? What does &amp;lsquo;ZeekHuge&amp;rsquo; means ?&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
Yeah, most of you might think that its a meaningless word, but believe me, it IS really meaningless. I was in my 7th/8th Std. and use to watch &amp;ldquo;The Suite Life of Zack &amp;amp; Cody&amp;rdquo; and one day a thought came in my mind, &amp;ldquo;Hey ! &amp;lsquo;Zeek&amp;rsquo; is such a good name and I can keep it as my secret name !&amp;rdquo;. AndA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
